<p class="uk-text-lead">The latest Environmental Quality Report (EQR) was released by the Environment Department (DOE) for 2017.</p>
<p>In it, rivers are classified from Class I to V – with I being the most pristine, drinkable water, to V being the worst, unsafe for any use. Class I to III rivers, meanwhile, can also host aquatic life while there is no life in Class IV and V rivers.</p>
<p>Sungai Kim Kim is a Class III (slightly polluted) river.</p>
<p>Out of 477 rivers nationwide monitored by the DOE that year, 51 were considered polluted. Twenty-seven of these, over 52.9 percent, were in Johor alone – with 12 Class III rivers, 14 Class IV and one Class V river.</p>
<p>Although the 2018 EQR has not been released at the time of writing, Energy, Science, Technology, Environment and Climate Change Minister Yeo Bee Yin was <a href="http://www.bernama.com/en/news.php?id=1707386" target="_blank">reported</a> saying in March that there are now 25 Class V rivers – otherwise known as ‘dead’ rivers – in the country, from just one in 2017.</p>

<div class="uk-column-1-2@m">
<p><i>Malaysiakini</i> visited three other rivers: Sungai Buluh, considered the second most polluted river in the country based on its water quality index (WQI) number; Sungai Masai, which runs through heavily populated areas and industrial zones; as well as Sungai Kim Kim, the site of the chemical waste incident in March.</p>
<p>Upon first inspection, Sungai Buluh was not a welcoming sight. Surrounded by factories on both sides, its water was turbid - a murky greenish brown - and moved sluggishly due to heavy debris and sediment. A bad smell also emanated from the river, mixing with the smell of smoke from nearby factories.</p>
<p><i>Malaysiakini</i> also witnessed wastewater being discharged from pipes running from the factories straight into the river. Whether this dumping falls within permissible standards set by authorities could not be ascertained, however.</p>
<p>The water was also greenish-brown at the mouth of Sungai Masai, where it pours into the Johor Straits. Several mangrove trees at the riverside had also been uprooted. Such trees serve to protect the banks from erosion, and help maintain water quality by filtering pollutants and trapping sediments from land.</p>
<p>At locations along Sungai Kim Kim only separated from people’s homes by several feet of small road and patches of grass, the foul smell from the highly murky river could easily be detected. <i>Malaysiakini</i> later also visited another part of the river which runs through an industrial area.</p>

<h2 class="uk-heading-small">What’s ailing the rivers?</h2>
<p class="uk-text-lead">The pollution of rivers in Pasir Gudang and adjacent areas is due to a host of reasons.</p>
<hr>
<p>One major factor is cramming in too many factories and plants in a single area, which would negate efforts by individual factories adhering to national standards when discharging waste.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote class="uk-padding">
<p class="uk-text-center uk-text-large">“So even if all the factories are complying with the law, it will still affect water quality because there are just so many (factories),” water quality and modelling specialist Zaki Zainudin told <i>Malaysiakini</i> over the phone.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>The law is the Environmental Quality (Industrial Effluent) Regulations 2009 which regulates the permissible levels of chemicals and other matters in industrial wastewater discharge.</p>
<p>There are similar regulations for discharges from sewage plants, solid waste transfer stations, landfills, prescribed premises and raw natural rubber plants.</p>
<div class="uk-margin-medium">
<img data-src="../img/bg_zaki.jpg" width="" height="" alt="Zaki" class="uk-width-1-1 uk-border-rounded" uk-img>
<p class="uk-text-meta">Zaki Zainudin has been monitoring rivers in Malaysia for the past 16 years, including the ones in Pasir Gudang.</p>
</div>
<p>Another reason cited was that the sewage treatment system in Pasir Gudang is purportedly very “rudimentary”. As Zaki claimed, “The systems in those areas are not modernised.”</p>
<p>Organic sewage and sullage are also released into the water, as well as direct discharge from squatter areas and villages.</p>
<p>There is also the illegal dumping of waste and chemicals, such as what transpired in the Sungai Kim Kim incident.</p>
<p>According to Zaki, “industrial premises… are supposed to treat their waste before discharging them, but maybe they cannot meet the limits or for whatever reason, so they release the waste when no one is looking.”</p>

<h2 class="uk-heading-small uk-margin-remove-top">Legal loophole</h2>
<p class="uk-text-lead">Even those disposing their wastewater within the legal limits can find themselves adding to the problem, thanks to a loophole in the law.</p>
</div>

</div>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="uk-child-width-1-2@m" uk-grid>
<div>
<p>Elaborating, Zaki said the most stringent standard for the concentration of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) in industrial discharge limits is at 20mg/L (Standard A). Industrial factories must treat wastewater to this limit of BOD before it is disposed of.</p>
<p>Standard A is used for water supply intakes downstream, whereas Standard B applies to any other inland waters or Malaysian waters.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The problem with this, he said, is that even the 20mg/L limit under Standard A is far above what the National Water Quality Standards considers a Class V river.</p>

<div class="uk-child-width-1-2@m" uk-grid>
<div>
<p>Under these standards – the guidelines used by the DOE to measure the water quality in rivers – anything above 12mg/L of BOD detected in rivers would place a river in Class V, essentially making it dead.</p>
<p>There are similar instances of this for other parameters, such as the concentration of ammoniacal nitrogen (AN), where the most stringent standard limits it to 10mg/L for industrial discharge. Under the National Water Quality Standards, anything above 2.7mg/L is considered Class V.</p>

<p>“Our most stringent regulation in terms of industrial effluent discharges, when you compare to the water quality standard, it is actually Class V. Why is that the case?</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<div class="uk-child-width-1-2@m" uk-grid>
<div>
<p>“It is because the regulations were drafted in such a way where they hope that the river will dilute some of the bad waste. The question is whether the rivers can dilute these or not?” Zaki said.</p>
<p>“When you have so many industrial premises packed into a small region, it’s just oversaturated. Some rivers could also be just a small river.”</p>
<p>Other countries, Zaki noted, have more comprehensive regulations that not only look at the concentration of chemicals and other substances in the water, but also the volume of discharged water and the size of the receiving river.</p>
<p>“Not only in the United States, but also Japan and Korea… but in Malaysia, we just look at the concentration of effluents,” he explained.</p>

<p class="uk-text-lead">Pasir Gudang was a collection of fishing villages before the Teochew people, who came from southern China, began planting crops like gambier and rubber along the riverbanks.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="uk-column-1-2@m">
<p>That changed after the Malayan Emergency ended in the 1960s. In 1977, the state government gave statutory body Johor Corporation the mandate to administer the town until 2009.</p>
<p>Many environmental laws did not exist at the time. The Pasir Gudang Municipal Council (MPPG) only took over local administration ten years ago.</p>
<p>Johor Corporation developed Pasir Gudang into an industrial area, paving the way for the establishment of the Johor Port, which became an alternative to the Port of Singapore.</p>
<p>Gan Kai Hui, who is involved in city planning in southern Johor, pointed out that this pattern of packing in so many industries into one area was meant to attract foreign investors.</p>

<p>However, Gan pointed out that there was a lack of foresight in the initial development of the industrial town, which contributed to the pollution concerns Pasir Gudang is facing today.</p>
<p>Back then, she claimed, the field of city planning was not very established in the country, so development plans were usually carried out by land surveyors and architects.</p>
<p>The initial development had focused so heavily on the industrial zones that nearly no attention was paid to future development, such as the nearby residential areas which began popping up nearby to accommodate those attracted by the burgeoning job opportunities.</p>
